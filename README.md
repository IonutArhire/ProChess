# ProChess

ProChess is a browser-based game which currently only supports the game mode where the user is making moves on behalf of both white and black players until the end of the game is reached.

The backend is made by me, from scratch, using .NET Core and SignalR while the frontend is taken from somewhere else and modified to fit my purposes.
